## Core Concepts

### Definition of Vibe Coding
- **Philosophy**: "See things, say things, run things" (Andrej Karpathy)
- **Approach**: AI-assisted development using natural language descriptions
- **Key Feature**: Human-in-the-loop methodology with continuous steering
- **Mental Model**: Treat AI as a "weirdly knowledgeable new hire" who needs constant guidance

### Definition of Agentic Coding
- **Philosophy**: "Set a goal, let an autonomous agent plan, code, test, and PR"
- **Approach**: Autonomous agents that interpret high-level goals with minimal human intervention
- **Key Feature**: Self-directed execution with integrated toolchain
- **Mental Model**: AI as an autonomous team member handling complete workflows

## Vibe Coding vs Agentic Coding

### Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | Vibe Coding | Agentic Coding |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Autonomy Level** | Human-in-the-loop, conversational | Fully autonomous execution |
| **Developer Role** | Intent Architect, Creative Director | Strategic Planner, Supervisor |
| **Best For** | Rapid prototyping, learning, exploration | Production tasks, maintenance, refactoring |
| **Risk Level** | Lower (continuous review) | Higher (silent failures possible) |
| **Debugging** | Manual, prompt-based | Autonomous with rollback capabilities |
| **Context Management** | Stateless interfaces | Persistent memory and context |
| **Execution** | Manual execution and testing | Integrated execution pipelines |

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use Vibe Coding for:**
- Rapid prototyping and MVPs

## Orchestration Strategies

### 1. Hierarchical Delegation Pattern
```yaml
structure:
  MAESTRO: Top-level orchestrator
  ├── Alpha Crew: Research & Planning
  ├── Beta Crew: Development & Implementation
  └── Gamma Crew: Quality & Excellence

workflow:
  1. MAESTRO receives requirements
  2. Delegates to appropriate crew
  3. Crews assign to specialized agents
  4. Results bubble up through hierarchy
```

### 2. Peer Review Pattern
- Horizontal validation between agents
- Example: ORION ← review → FORTRESS
- Ensures quality through cross-validation
- Prevents siloed decision-making

### 3. Swarming Pattern
- Multiple agents collaborate on complex problems
- Example: [FORTRESS, VULCAN, SENTINEL] → Security incident
- Enables rapid response to critical issues
- Leverages collective intelligence

### 4. Pipeline Pattern
- Sequential processing through specialized agents
- Example: RESEARCHER → ARCHITECT → ORION → SENTINEL
- Clear handoffs and dependencies
- Optimal for well-defined workflows

### 5. Consensus Pattern
- Multi-agent agreement for critical decisions
- Example: [ARCHITECT, FORTRESS, CRONOS] → vote → decision
- Reduces single point of failure
- Ensures balanced decision-making

## Multi-Agent Coordination

### Core Agent Capabilities Required
1. **Goal Interpretation**: Parse and understand high-level objectives
2. **Task Decomposition**: Break complex goals into executable steps
3. **Tool Utilization**: Access and use external tools and APIs
4. **Execution & Iteration**: Run code, test, and refine
5. **Problem Solving**: Apply reasoning to overcome obstacles
6. **Context Maintenance**: Preserve long-term memory and state
7. **Self-Correction**: Identify and fix own mistakes

### Architectural Components
```yaml
essential_infrastructure:
  - Goal planning system
  - Task decomposition engine
  - Execution environments (sandboxed)
  - Safety infrastructure
  - Continuous feedback mechanisms
  - Vector memory stores
  - Context prioritization queues
  - Embedded scanners (static/dynamic)
```

### Interaction Protocols
```typescript
interface AgentRequest {
  agent: string;           // Agent codename
  task: string;           // Specific request
  context: Context;       // Relevant background
  constraints: string[];  // Boundaries & limitations
  deliverables: string[]; // Expected outputs
  deadline: Date;         // Time constraint
  priority: 'P0' | 'P1' | 'P2' | 'P3';
}
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Structure Your Prompts
```markdown
## Role & Context
You are [AGENT_NAME], specialized in [DOMAIN].

## Task
[Clear, specific description of what needs to be done]

## Constraints
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

## Expected Output
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

## Examples
[Provide concrete examples when possible]

What questions do you have before we begin?
```

### 2. Chain-of-Vibes Technique
- Break large tasks into reviewable segments
- Create checkpoints between major steps
- Request planning before execution
- Ask for clarifying questions

### 3. Context Management
- Keep context windows focused
- Use `CLAUDE.md` files for persistent context
- Clear conversations when switching features
- Provide selective, relevant information

### 4. Prompt Refinement Strategies
- Start broad, then narrow specificity
- Request simplification of complex solutions
- Ask for test cases with implementation
- Iterate based on outputs

---

## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Explore → Plan → Code → Commit
```yaml
explore:
  - Read existing codebase
  - Understand conventions
  - Identify dependencies

plan:
  - Outline approach
  - Define milestones
  - Identify risks

code:
  - Implement incrementally
  - Test continuously
  - Document inline

commit:
  - Review changes
  - Run final tests
  - Push with clear message
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) with AI
1. Write failing tests first
2. Confirm tests actually fail
3. Generate code to pass tests
4. Verify implementation isn't overfitting
5. Refactor with confidence

### 3. Multi-Instance Review Pattern
- Instance 1: Write initial code
- Instance 2: Independent code review
- Instance 3: Security audit
- Human: Final approval and merge

### 4. Parallel Development Branches
- Run multiple solution attempts simultaneously
- Compare approaches
- Merge best elements
- Maintain fallback options

#### 1. Create Comprehensive Documentation
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md Structure
- Project overview
- Architecture decisions

```yaml
rules:
  prevent:
    - Unnecessary complexity
